# Dashboard Redesign - Ultra-Modern UI

## Changes Made

### Visual Design
- **Matching Index.tsx aesthetic**: Applied the same ultra-modern design language from the landing page
- **Mouse-following gradient overlay**: Dynamic radial gradient that follows cursor position for immersive feel
- **StarField background**: Consistent animated star field across all pages
- **Glass morphism cards**: Semi-transparent cards with backdrop blur for depth
- **Gradient text**: Purple-to-pink gradients matching brand identity
- **Smooth animations**: Hover effects, scale transforms, and transitions

### New Features
- **Metric tooltips**: Added HelpCircle (?) icons next to each metric name
  - Hover to see detailed explanations of what each metric measures
  - Uses shadcn/ui Tooltip component with dark theme
- **Improved verdict display**:
  - Larger, more prominent verdict card with glass morphism
  - CheckCircle/XCircle icons instead of static images
  - Glowing effects around verdict icons
- **Back to Home button**: Added at top with smooth hover animation
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Metric Descriptions (Tooltips)
1. **Sharpness Variance**: "Measures edge clarity using multi-scale Laplacian analysis. AI-generated content often shows unnaturally smooth or overly sharp edges."

2. **High Frequency Ratio**: "Analyzes the ratio of high-frequency components in the Fourier spectrum. Deepfakes typically lack natural high-frequency details."

3. **Edge Glitch Score**: "Detects inconsistencies in edge boundaries across small tiles. AI generation can create subtle artifacts at edge transitions."

4. **Block Energy**: "Examines compression grid patterns at 8x8 block boundaries. Deepfakes often show unusual block boundary energy."

5. **Chroma Mismatch**: "Checks color channel consistency. AI-generated faces may have unnatural color relationships between channels."

### Preserved Functionality
- All existing analysis result logic remains unchanged
- Metric calculations (score, value) work exactly as before
- SessionStorage integration for results and video info
- Debug panel with raw JSON data
- Navigate back to home and clear results

### Technical Changes
- Removed dependencies on MetricCard component (custom inline implementation)
- Added TooltipProvider from shadcn/ui
- Added mousePosition state for gradient overlay
- Removed Card component import (using div with custom classes)
- Added CheckCircle and XCircle from lucide-react

## Color Scheme
- Primary gradient: Purple (rgb(168, 85, 247)) to Pink (rgb(236, 72, 153))
- Background overlays: Purple/Pink at 20-40% opacity with blur
- Text: White with gradient accents
- Borders: White at 10% opacity for glass effect

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: Single column layout
- Tablet (md): 2-column metric grid
- Desktop (lg): 3-column metric grid
